## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- XAMPP  local server environment with PHP and MySQL
- Composer (for managing dependencies)



### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Karan7426/Weather-Data-Emailer
    cd weather_data_emailer
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    composer install
    ```

3. **Set up your database**:
    - Start XAMPP and ensure Apache and MySQL are running.
    - Open `phpMyAdmin` (http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
    - Create a new database, e.g.`weather_task_db`.

4. **Configure the application**:
    - Open the `app/Config/Database.php` file and connect with database:
        ```php
        public array $default = [
            'DSN'          => '',
            'hostname'     => 'localhost',
            'username'     => 'root',
            'password'     => '',
            'database'     => 'weather_db',
            'DBDriver'     => 'MySQLi',  
             
        ];
        ```

5. ## Database Schema for database name weather_db

The database schema for the `users` and `weather_data` tables is as follows:

### `users` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE `users` (
    `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    `full_name` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

    `password` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    `created_on` DATETIME NOT NULL,
    `is_active` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1
);

CREATE TABLE `weather_data` (
    `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    `user_id` INT NOT NULL,
    `location` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    `date` DATE NOT NULL,
    `temperature` DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
    `humidity` DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
    `weather_description` TEXT NOT NULL,
    `pressure` DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
